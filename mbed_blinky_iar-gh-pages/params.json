Begin by creating a developer account on the [mbed developer site](http://developer.mbed.org).\r\n2. Import mbed_blinky and make sure that you can compile and run it using the online compiler.\r\n3. Export mbed_blinky to IAR, save and unzip the project.\r\n4. Make sure that you're using the latest IAR EWARM - I used 7.40. Open the mbed_blinky workspace.\r\n5.
